# Mini-Project
# Automated DNA Classification Using Modern Deep Learning Strategies

## 📘 Project Type
Final Year B.Tech Project – Computer Science and Engineering  
Vardhaman College of Engineering, JNTUH (2022–2026)

## 🧬 Project Overview
This project presents a hybrid deep learning approach for DNA sequence classification by combining Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network (RRCNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) models.

It aims to achieve high accuracy in identifying and classifying DNA sequences to support various applications in genomics, disease diagnosis, and bioinformatics. The hybrid model successfully addresses the challenges of feature extraction and sequence pattern understanding in biological data.
